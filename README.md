The Tic Tac Toe game with MySQL score recording is an interactive and engaging project developed using the Python programming language and the Tkinter graphical user interface library. This project aims to offer users a classic Tic Tac Toe gaming experience while incorporating a sophisticated MySQL database system to record and manage player scores.
The core features of this project include an intuitive GUI designed with Tkinter, enabling users to interact with the game easily. Players can make moves by clicking on the grid cells, and the system will determine the game's outcome, announcing the winner or a draw. Additionally, the project utilizes a MySQL database to record player name, name of winning player and time at which the game was played.
By integrating a database, the project provides a seamless way to maintain player scores persistently. Every completed game will be stored in the database, ensuring that players can view their past performance and track their improvements over time. Furthermore, this MySQL-backed system opens up possibilities for future expansions, such as user registration, player statistics, and leaderboards.
